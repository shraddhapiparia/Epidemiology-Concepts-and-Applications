$$\mathrm{Attack Rate} = \frac{\mathrm{Number of new~cases~within~a~time~period}}{\mathrm{Total~number~of~people~at~risk~during~the~same~period}}$$

$$\mathrm{Attack\,Rate} = \frac{\mathrm{Number\ of\ new\ cases\ within\ a\ time\ period}}{\mathrm{Total\,number\,of\,people\,at\,risk\,during\,the\,same\,period}}$$


$$Risk Ratio = \frac{Risk~in~exposed~group}{Risk~in~unexposed~group}$$

# Measures of Morbidity
## Point Prevalence
The point prevalence is the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular disease or condition at a specific point in time.
$$\mathrm{Point Prevalence} = \frac{\text{# of existing cases of disease}}{\text{# of persons in the population}}$$

## Period Prevalence
The period prevalence is the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular disease or condition during a specified period of time.
$$\frac{\text{# of existing cases of disease}}{\text{# of persons in the population}}$$

## Incidence
The incidence is the number of new cases of a particular disease or condition that occur in a population during a specified period of time.
(Incidence is a measure of risk, prevalence is not)
$$\frac{\text{# of new cases of disease}}{\text{# of persons at risk of developing the disease}}$$

## Incidence Density
The incidence density is the number of new cases of a particular disease or condition that occur in a population during a specified period of time, divided by the person-time at risk.
$$\frac{\text{# of new cases of disease}}{\text{person-time at risk}}$$

# Measures of Mortality
## Annual Mortality Rate
The annual mortality rate is the number of deaths from all causes in a population in one year, divided by the number of persons in the population at midyear.
$$\frac{\text{Total No. of deaths from all causes in one year}}{\text{No. of persons in the population at midyear}}$$

## Annual Age-Specific Mortality
The annual age-specific mortality is the number of deaths from all causes to children under a specific years of age in one year, divided by the number of children under a specific years of age in the population at midyear.
$$\frac{\text{Total No. of deaths (all causes) to children under a specific yrs of age in 1 yr}}{\text{No. of children under a specific yrs of age in population at midyear}}$$

## Annual Disease-Specific Mortality

$$\frac{\text{Total No. of deaths from a specific cause 1 year}}{\text{No. of persons in the population at midyear}}$$

## Annual Age and Disease Specific

$$\frac{\text{Total No. of deaths from specific cause in children for a specific group in 1 yr}}{\text{No. of children in a specific group in the population at midyear}}$$

## Case Fatality Rate
$$\frac{\text{Total No. of deaths due to the disease in a time period}}{\text{No. of people with the disease in the time period}}$$

## Proportionate Mortality (proportion not a rate)

$$\frac{\text{No. of deaths from a specific cause in 1 year}}{\text{Total deaths in the population in 1 year}}$$
