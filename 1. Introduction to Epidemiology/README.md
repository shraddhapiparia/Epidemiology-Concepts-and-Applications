# Epidemiology
## Definition
The study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in human populations

## Objectives
Identify the etiology/cause of the disease and relevant risk factors
Determine the extent of the disease in the population
Study the natural history and prognosis of the disease
Evaluate both existing and newly developed preventive measures and modes of health care delivery
Provide foundation for developing public health policy

## Goals
1. Identify the etiology/cause of the disease and relevant risk factors

2. Determine the extent of the disease in the population
	- Assess the disease burden, identify subgroups and develop surveillance methods

3. Study the natural history and prognosis of the disease
	- Determine severity, lethality, duration and survivorship

4. Evaluate both existing and newly developed preventive measures and modes of health care delivery
	- Identify optimal treatment methods
	
5. Provide foundation for developing public health policy
	- Assess and moderate impact on environment & other populations

## Areas of study
Observational (descriptive) such as cross-sectional studies
Experimental (analytical) such as randomized control trials, cohort studies

# Key terms
### Population
The entire group of individuals or objects that share a common characteristic and are of interest to the researcher.

### Sample
A subset of the population that is selected for study to represent the larger population.

### Exposure
The variable or factor that is hypothesized to cause a particular outcome or disease in a study.

### Outcome
The result or endpoint of interest in a study, often a health-related condition or disease.

### Epidemic curve
Characterized by a rapid explosive rise in the number of cases in the first 16 hours.

### Herd immunity
The	resistance of a group to an attack by a disease to which a large proportion of the group members are immune. The larger the proportion of immune persons in a population decreases the likelihood that a person with disease will come in contact with susceptible individuals


# Historical development of epidemiology and its evolution as a discipline
Epidemiology, as a field of study, has undergone significant changes since its inception. The development of epidemiology can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where observations on the spread of disease and efforts to control its spread were made.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the study of epidemiology was limited to the description of outbreaks of infectious diseases. It was only in the 19th century that the discipline of epidemiology began to emerge as a scientific field, with the work of John Snow on the cholera epidemic in London.

In the early 20th century, epidemiology expanded beyond the study of infectious diseases to include chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. This led to the development of new research methods, such as cohort studies and case-control studies.

In the latter half of the 20th century, epidemiology became more interdisciplinary, with contributions from fields such as genetics, social sciences, and environmental sciences. Advances in technology and computing also allowed for more sophisticated data analysis and modeling.

Today, epidemiology continues to evolve, with an increased focus on global health, health disparities, and the social determinants of health. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of epidemiology in understanding and controlling the spread of infectious diseases.

## Patterns of Disease
•	Endemic Disease
	- The habitual presence of a disease within a given geographic area

•	Epidemic disease
	- The occurrence of disease in a community or region, clearly in excess of normal expectancy and derived from a common or propagated source

•	Pandemic Disease
	- Worldwide epidemic


# Differences between descriptive and analytical epidemiology
## Purpose
Descriptive epidemiology is used to describe the distribution of disease within a population. It provides information on the frequency and pattern of disease occurrence, as well as the characteristics of the affected population. Analytical epidemiology, on the other hand, is used to investigate the causes of disease by testing hypotheses about the relationship between exposures and outcomes.

## Study design
Descriptive epidemiology typically uses observational study designs, such as cross-sectional studies, to collect data on the frequency and distribution of disease in a population. Analytical epidemiology, on the other hand, often uses experimental or quasi-experimental study designs, such as randomized controlled trials and cohort studies, to investigate causal relationships between exposures and outcomes.

## Data analysis
Descriptive epidemiology often involves summarizing data using measures of central tendency (such as means and medians) and measures of dispersion (such as standard deviations and interquartile ranges). Analytical epidemiology, on the other hand, uses statistical tests and modeling techniques to test hypotheses and estimate the strength of associations between exposures and outcomes.

## Use of hypothesis
Descriptive epidemiology does not usually involve testing hypotheses about the causes of disease, but rather focuses on describing patterns of disease occurrence. Analytical epidemiology, on the other hand, involves generating and testing hypotheses about the causes of disease.

## Basis of decision making
Descriptive epidemiology is often used to inform public health decision-making and resource allocation. Analytical epidemiology, on the other hand, is used to identify risk factors and inform the development of interventions to prevent or treat disease.

In summary, while descriptive epidemiology focuses on describing patterns of disease occurrence, analytical epidemiology is used to investigate the causes of disease and inform the development of interventions to prevent or treat disease.


# Epidemiological models and frameworks

## Epidemiological triangle
The epidemiological triangle is a classic model that describes the relationship between the host (the person or population affected by the disease), the agent (the cause of the disease), and the environment (the external factors that influence the occurrence of the disease). According to this model, disease occurs when a susceptible host is exposed to an infectious agent in a conducive environment.

### Host characteristics 
such as age, sex, race, occupation, religion, customs, family background, previous diseases, immune status, genetic profile, and marital status can all influence an individual's susceptibility to disease.
### Agents of disease 
can be biological, chemical, physical, or nutritional in nature.
### Environmental factors 
like temperature, humidity, altitude, crowding, housing, neighborhoods, water, milk, food, radiation, air pollution, and noise can also play a role in disease transmission and spread.

## Web of causation
The web of causation is another model that describes the complex interplay between various factors that contribute to the occurrence of a disease or health outcome. It includes multiple levels of causation, ranging from individual-level factors such as genetics and behavior, to community-level factors such as social norms and policies, and to broader societal and environmental factors. The model emphasizes the importance of addressing the underlying determinants of health, rather than just treating the disease or its symptoms.

# Applications of epidemiology, such as disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, and program evaluation

## Disease surveillance
Epidemiologists use disease surveillance systems to monitor and track the occurrence of diseases in populations. This information can help public health officials identify outbreaks, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and inform public health policies.

## Outbreak investigation
1.	Define the outbreak
2.	Examine distribution of cases by time and place
3.	Develop hypothesis
4.	Test hypothesis
5.	Recommend control measures

## Program evaluation
Epidemiologists evaluate public health programs to assess their effectiveness in achieving their goals. This information can help public health officials identify areas for improvement and make evidence-based decisions about resource allocation.

## Risk assessment
Epidemiologists use risk assessment methods to identify and quantify the risks associated with exposure to environmental and occupational hazards. This information can help public health officials develop policies and regulations to protect public health.
