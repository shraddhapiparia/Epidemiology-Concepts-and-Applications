# Definition of disease prevalence and incidence, and how they are calculated

## Prevalence
Prevalence refers to the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular disease at a specific point in time. It includes both existing and new cases of the disease. Prevalence is often expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the number of individuals with the disease by the total number of individuals in the population.

## Incidence
Incidence, on the other hand, refers to the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specified period of time. It includes only new cases and excludes existing cases. Incidence is often expressed as a rate (e.g., number of new cases per 100,000 person-years) and is calculated by dividing the number of new cases of the disease by the total number of individuals at risk of developing the disease during the same period.

Prevalence = Incidence X Duration

## Low incidence and long duration

Incidence: Low Risk N = 4/yr.
 
Duration: Long 25 Yrs.

(25 x 4) Prevalence

From the given information, we can infer that there are low numbers of new cases occurring per year, with only 4 new cases occurring each year (N = 4/yr). This suggests a low incidence rate for the condition being studied. However, the duration of the condition is long, spanning 25 years. Therefore, while the incidence rate is low, the prevalence rate (total number of cases in the population at a given time) may be high due to the extended period of time during which the condition persists.

## High incidence and short duration

Incidence: High Risk N = 20/yr.
 
Duration: Short 3 Yrs.

(20 X 3) Prevalence

This information implies that the disease is spreading rapidly and affecting a significant proportion of the population over a short period of time. The high incidence rate also suggests that there may be a high risk of transmission or exposure to the disease, and appropriate measures should be taken to control or prevent its spread.

# Problems with incidence and prevalence measurements

## Problems with numerator

1. Defining who has the disease: Prevalence estimate is significantly affected by the set of criteria used hence expert groups sets of diagnostic criteria.

2. How to find cases: Ascertaining which persons shoul be included in denominator. Use regularly available data or specifically design interviews from participants. Some problems associated with interviews include:

2a. Problems in diagnosis such as asymptomatic participants, symptomatic participant with no medical attention hence may not know the name of the disease, symptomatic participant with medical attention but diagnosis has not been made or conveyed or participant may have misunderstood, and the participant may not accurately recall an episode of event or illness and exposures related to illness.

2b. Problems associated with participants such as the participant may have involved in litigation about the illness and may choose not to respond or alter their response, the participant may be reluctant to provide accurate information if they have concerns that certain responses may not please the interviewer and if participant is too ill to respond and is not included in the interview or a surrogate is interviewed who may have ncomplete information about the illness.

2c. Problems associated with interviewers include that participants may provide the information but interviewer may not record it or may record it incorrectly, the interviewer may ask the question incorrectly, the interviewer maybe biased by knowing the hypothesis being tested and may probe more intensively in one group of participants than in another.




# Differences between prevalence and incidence, and when each measure is appropriate to use

Prevalence is appropriate to use when the goal is to understand the burden of a disease in a population at a given point in time. It is useful in determining the overall prevalence of a disease in a population and can provide insight into the need for public health interventions. Prevalence can also be used to estimate the duration and severity of a disease in a population. 

Incidence, on the other hand, is appropriate to use when the goal is to understand the risk of developing a disease in a population over time. It is useful in determining the rate at which new cases of a disease are occurring in a population and can provide insight into the underlying causes and risk factors associated with the disease. Incidence can also be used to track changes in the occurrence of a disease over time and to evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions in reducing the incidence of a disease.


# Factors that influence disease prevalence and incidence

There are several factors that influence prevalence and incidence some of which includes age, sex, geographic location, genetics, environmental factors, and lyfestyle factors.


# Use of prevalence and incidence to describe disease burden and trends over time

The prevalence of a disease provides information about the overall burden of the disease in a population. For example, a high prevalence of a disease suggests that a large number of people in the population are affected by the disease, which can have significant implications for healthcare services, public health policy, and the economy. Prevalence can also be used to track changes in disease burden over time, such as increases or decreases in the number of cases.

Incidence, on the other hand, provides information about the rate at which new cases of a disease are occurring in a population. This can be useful for identifying risk factors for the disease, as well as for predicting future trends in disease burden. For example, if the incidence of a disease is increasing over time, this may indicate that there are environmental or lifestyle factors contributing to the rise in cases.


# Limitations and challenges associated with measuring disease prevalence and incidence

Diagnostic criteria: The accuracy of disease prevalence and incidence estimates can be affected by the diagnostic criteria used to identify cases of the disease. If the criteria are too broad or too narrow, this can lead to overestimates or underestimates of disease burden.

Reporting bias: Prevalence and incidence estimates can also be affected by reporting bias, which occurs when individuals do not report symptoms or seek medical care for a disease. This can lead to underestimates of disease burden. More complicated diseases have asymptomatic presence too.

Data availability: In some cases, data on disease prevalence and incidence may not be readily available, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where surveillance systems may be limited.

Changes in disease definition: Changes in the definition or classification of a disease over time can also affect prevalence and incidence estimates. For example, the criteria for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder have changed over time, which has led to changes in prevalence estimates.

Population migration: Prevalence and incidence estimates can also be affected by population migration. If individuals move to or from an area with a high disease burden, this can affect estimates of disease prevalence and incidence in both the origin and destination areas.

Comorbidity: When a person has more than one disease, it can be difficult to accurately estimate the prevalence and incidence of each disease separately.
