# Definition of disease prevalence and incidence, and how they are calculated

## Prevalence
Prevalence refers to the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular disease at a specific point in time. It includes both existing and new cases of the disease. Prevalence is often expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the number of individuals with the disease by the total number of individuals in the population.

## Incidence
Incidence, on the other hand, refers to the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specified period of time. It includes only new cases and excludes existing cases. Incidence is often expressed as a rate (e.g., number of new cases per 100,000 person-years) and is calculated by dividing the number of new cases of the disease by the total number of individuals at risk of developing the disease during the same period.

Prevalence = Incidence X Duration

## Low incidence and long duration

Incidence: Low Risk N = 4/yr.
 
Duration: Long 25 Yrs.

(25 x 4) Prevalence

From the given information, we can infer that there are low numbers of new cases occurring per year, with only 4 new cases occurring each year (N = 4/yr). This suggests a low incidence rate for the condition being studied. However, the duration of the condition is long, spanning 25 years. Therefore, while the incidence rate is low, the prevalence rate (total number of cases in the population at a given time) may be high due to the extended period of time during which the condition persists.

## High incidence and short duration

Incidence: High Risk N = 20/yr.
 
Duration: Short 3 Yrs.
 

(20 X 3) Prevalence

This information implies that the disease is spreading rapidly and affecting a significant proportion of the population over a short period of time. The high incidence rate also suggests that there may be a high risk of transmission or exposure to the disease, and appropriate measures should be taken to control or prevent its spread.

# Differences between prevalence and incidence, and when each measure is appropriate to use

Prevalence is appropriate to use when the goal is to understand the burden of a disease in a population at a given point in time. It is useful in determining the overall prevalence of a disease in a population and can provide insight into the need for public health interventions. Prevalence can also be used to estimate the duration and severity of a disease in a population. 

Incidence, on the other hand, is appropriate to use when the goal is to understand the risk of developing a disease in a population over time. It is useful in determining the rate at which new cases of a disease are occurring in a population and can provide insight into the underlying causes and risk factors associated with the disease. Incidence can also be used to track changes in the occurrence of a disease over time and to evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions in reducing the incidence of a disease.
