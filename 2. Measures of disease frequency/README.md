# Types of measurements commonly used in Epidemiology
## Proportions
25 males/50 people = 0.50 or 50%

## Rates
number of cases/population, cohort, sample in a specified time period 
  all in the denominator have the potential to be in the  numerator
  Ratios
  An expression of the relationship between numerator and
  denominator where they are two separate and distinct 
  quantities:  25 females/29 males


# Definition of disease prevalence and incidence, and how they are calculated

## Prevalence
Prevalence refers to the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular disease at a specific point in time. It includes both existing and new cases of the disease. Prevalence is often expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the number of individuals with the disease by the total number of individuals in the population.

## Incidence
Incidence, on the other hand, refers to the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specified period of time. It includes only new cases and excludes existing cases. Incidence is often expressed as a rate (e.g., number of new cases per 100,000 person-years) and is calculated by dividing the number of new cases of the disease by the total number of individuals at risk of developing the disease during the same period.

Prevalence = Incidence X Duration


# Differences between prevalence and incidence, and when each measure is appropriate to use

Prevalence is appropriate to use when the goal is to understand the burden of a disease in a population at a given point in time. It is useful in determining the overall prevalence of a disease in a population and can provide insight into the need for public health interventions. Prevalence can also be used to estimate the duration and severity of a disease in a population. 

Incidence, on the other hand, is appropriate to use when the goal is to understand the risk of developing a disease in a population over time. It is useful in determining the rate at which new cases of a disease are occurring in a population and can provide insight into the underlying causes and risk factors associated with the disease. Incidence can also be used to track changes in the occurrence of a disease over time and to evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions in reducing the incidence of a disease.
