# BIAS, CONFOUNDING, AND INTERACTION

## TYPES OF BIAS

### Selection Bias

It occurs when there is a systematic difference between the individuals who are selected for the study and those who are not, resulting in an overestimation or underestimation of the true association. Examples include sampling bias, non-response bias, and loss to follow-up bias.
Berkson’s bias (Joseph Berkson) – hospital based bias; 

#### TYPES OF SELECTION BIAS
Self-selection bias occurs when participants self-select into a study

Volunteer bias (worried at risk, worried with disease) occurs when individuals who are worried at risk or with disease volunteer for a study

Response/non-response bias occurs when individuals who do or do not respond to a study differ in their characteristics

Healthy worker effect occurs when employed populations have a lower incidence of certain health outcomes

Mortality bias occurs when the study population is not representative of the overall population due to differences in mortality rates

Migration bias occurs when individuals migrate into or out of a study population
Cohort effect refers to differences in characteristics between different birth cohorts.


### Information Bias

It occurs when there is an error or distortion in the measurement of exposure or outcome data, resulting in an overestimation or underestimation of the true association. Examples include bias in abstracting records (such as medical, employment, etc.), bias from surrogate interviews (intervieweing family member about deceased individual), recall bias, interviewer bias, and surveillance bias (monitored population vs general population).

#### TYPES OF INFORMATION BIAS

Surveillance bias occurs when a more detailed search for disease is conducted in a group of people who are being monitored more closely than others.

Diagnostic suspicion bias: occurs when the knowledge of exposure or other factors influences testing and diagnosis of the disease in a way that may not reflect the true prevalence of the disease.

Interviewer bias occurs when the interviewer's behavior or communication style influences the participant's responses in a way that may not reflect their true beliefs or behaviors.

Recall bias occurs when participants inaccurately remember or report information about their past exposure or experiences.

Unacceptability bias occurs when individuals who are not willing to disclose sensitive information or participate in a study differ in their characteristics from those who do participate.

Family information bias occurs when family members or close contacts of study participants provide inaccurate or biased information about the participant's exposure or outcome status.

Loss-to-follow-up/drop out bias occurs when participants who are lost to follow-up or drop out of a study differ in their characteristics from those who continue to participate.

Misclassification bias occurs when participants are inaccurately classified as exposed or unexposed, or as having or not having the outcome of interest.

Response fatigue bias occurs when participants become fatigued or disengaged during a study and provide less accurate or complete responses over time.

## CONFOUNDING

Confounding occurs when the association between an exposure and an outcome is distorted by the presence of a third variable, known as a confounder. Confounders are variables that are associated with both the exposure and the outcome, and they can lead to a false association between the exposure and the outcome if they are not properly controlled for. For example, if a study found that coffee consumption was associated with an increased risk of heart disease, but did not control for smoking, which is a known risk factor for heart disease and is also associated with coffee consumption, then smoking could be a confounding variable that is distorting the true association between coffee consumption and heart disease.

## INTERACTION

Interaction, on the other hand, occurs when the effect of an exposure on an outcome depends on the presence or absence of another factor, known as an effect modifier. Effect modifiers are variables that modify the effect of the exposure on the outcome, and they can lead to different associations between the exposure and outcome in different subgroups of the population. For example, if a study found that the effect of a certain medication on blood pressure depended on the age of the patient, with older patients experiencing a stronger effect than younger patients, then age would be an effect modifier that is modifying the effect of the medication on blood pressure.


# Strategies to minimize and control for bias and confounding

Randomization: This involves randomly assigning study participants to either the intervention group or the control group, which helps to balance out any potential confounding variables between the two groups.

Blinding: This involves keeping study participants, investigators, or outcome assessors unaware of which group a participant has been assigned to, which helps to reduce the potential for bias in the study.

Matching: This involves matching study participants based on certain characteristics, such as age, gender, or disease severity, which helps to control for confounding factors that may vary between the groups.

Stratification: This involves dividing study participants into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as age, gender, or disease severity, which helps to control for confounding factors that may vary between the subgroups.

Adjustment: This involves using statistical methods, such as multivariable regression analysis, to control for confounding factors in the analysis of the study data.

Sensitivity analysis: This involves testing the robustness of the study results to different assumptions and scenarios, which helps to assess the potential impact of bias or confounding on the study results.

# Examples of bias and confounding in epidemiological studies, and their potential impact on study results and conclusions

Selection bias: In a study examining the relationship between maternal age and risk of congenital anomalies in newborns, researchers recruited participants from a hospital-based registry. However, this method excluded home births and births in other hospitals, which may have led to an underestimation of the true association between maternal age and congenital anomalies.


Information bias: In a study examining the association between smoking and lung cancer, researchers used self-reported smoking status as their exposure variable. However, individuals may underreport their smoking status, leading to misclassification bias and an underestimation of the true association between smoking and lung cancer.

Confounding bias: In a study examining the association between coffee consumption and risk of heart disease, researchers found a positive association between the two. However, after adjusting for smoking status, which is a known confounding variable for heart disease, the association between coffee consumption and heart disease was no longer significant. This suggests that smoking was confounding the relationship between coffee consumption and heart disease, leading to a false positive association.

Publication bias: In a systematic review examining the effectiveness of a certain medication for a particular condition, the researchers found that the majority of published studies reported positive results, while unpublished studies were more likely to report negative results. This publication bias may have led to an overestimation of the true effectiveness of the medication.

Survivorship bias: In a study examining the relationship between BMI and mortality, researchers included only individuals who survived to a certain age. However, this method excluded individuals who died before the study endpoint, leading to a survivorship bias and an overestimation of the true association between BMI and mortality.

# Importance of careful study design and analysis to minimize bias and confounding, and enhance the validity and reliability of study findings

Ensure accurate results: Bias and confounding can lead to inaccurate or biased study results. By carefully designing and analyzing a study, researchers can minimize the impact of these factors and ensure that the results accurately reflect the true relationship between the exposure and outcome.

Enhance external validity: Careful study design and analysis can help to enhance the external validity of study findings, which refers to the extent to which the results can be generalized to other populations or settings. By minimizing bias and confounding, researchers can enhance the generalizability of their results and make more informed recommendations for public health interventions.

Improve credibility: A study that is carefully designed and analyzed is more likely to be credible and reliable. This can help to build trust in the scientific community and among the public, and can increase the likelihood that the study findings will be used to inform policy decisions.

Ensure ethical research: Conducting research that is free from bias and confounding is an ethical responsibility of researchers. By minimizing these factors, researchers can ensure that their findings are not misused or misinterpreted, and can protect the welfare of study participants.

# Types of association and how to judge them

Chance: Chance is the possibility of obtaining an association between exposure and outcome by random error, rather than a true causal association. The significance level is a way to judge the likelihood that the observed association occurred by chance. For example, if the p-value is less than 0.05, it means that there is less than a 5% chance that the observed association occurred by chance.

Bias: Bias is a systematic error that occurs in the study design or conduct, which can lead to an association that does not reflect the true causal relationship. For example, selection bias can occur when the study participants are not representative of the general population, leading to an association that may not be generalizable to the population as a whole.

Confounding: Confounding occurs when a third variable is associated with both the exposure and outcome, and is not controlled for in the analysis. For example, a study may find an association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer, but this association may be confounded by smoking, as smoking is a known risk factor for lung cancer and is also associated with alcohol consumption. If smoking is not controlled for in the analysis, it may lead to a false association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer.

Causal: When a study is randomized, the association can be stated as causal but such studies are expensive. Hence this association can be achieved via the following:

Strength: The strength of an association is judged by the magnitude of the effect size, usually measured as the relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR). For example, a study may find that the risk of lung cancer is 20 times higher among heavy smokers compared to non-smokers, indicating a strong association between smoking and lung cancer.

Consistency: Consistency refers to the presence of similar findings across numerous studies, which increases the likelihood that the observed association is true. For example, multiple studies have found a consistent association between smoking and lung cancer, further supporting the causal relationship between the two.

Linearity: Linearity refers to the presence of a dose-response relationship between the exposure and outcome, where higher levels of exposure lead to higher levels of risk. For example, studies have found that the risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, indicating a dose-response relationship between smoking and lung cancer.

Temporality: Temporality refers to the presence of a clear time sequence between exposure and outcome, where the exposure occurs before the outcome. For example, in order to establish a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer, it must be demonstrated that smoking occurred before the onset of lung cancer.

Coherence: Coherence refers to the presence of biologic plausibility between the exposure and outcome, where the exposure is consistent with known biologic mechanisms for the outcome. For example, smoking is known to cause lung cancer through the accumulation of carcinogens in the lungs, which is a biologically plausible mechanism for the observed association between smoking and lung cancer.
