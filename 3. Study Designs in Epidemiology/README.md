Definition and characteristics of different types of epidemiological study designs, including cross-sectional, case-control, cohort studies, and clinical trials

# Types of study design

Always have exposure as rows and disease as column in 2X2 table like this:
| Exposure/Disease | Y        | N        |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Y               | a        | b        |
| N               | c        | d        |


## Cross-sectional Studies (Prevalence Studies)

Descriptive study.

Provides a snapshot of the population under study.

Risk Factor and Disease are determined at the same time.

Can calculate prevalence but not incidence or duration.

Begin with defined population --> Collect data on exposure and disease --> Four groups with 0,1 Exposure and 0,1 Disease --> Perform analysis

MEASURES:

$$\mathrm{Prevalence Ratio} = \frac{\text{Prevalence of disease in exposed}}{\text{Prevalence of disease in unexposed}}$$

## Prospective Studies (Incidence Studies)

Begin with persons without the disease of interest.

Collect information related to risks and exposures.

Follow subjects and record whether or not disease develops.

Often subjects are followed for more than one outcome.

Population who does not have a disease --> Select exposed / unexposed --> Four groups with 0,1 Exposure and 0,1 Disease --> Perform analysis

MEASURES:

$$\mathrm{Incidence rate} = \frac{\text{Number of NEW cases of disease in a population}}{\text{Number of persons at risk of developing disease}}$$

$$\mathrm{Risk Ratio} = \frac{\text{Risk of disease in exposed}}{\text{Risk of disease in unexposed}}$$

Relative risk measures the strength of an association.

Relative risk does not have information about the actual risk of the disease (this is measured with incidence)

$$\mathrm{Relative Risk} = \frac{\text{Prevalence of disease in exposed}}{\text{Prevalence of disease in unexposed}}$$

$$\mathrm{Risk Difference} = \text{Prevalence of disease in exposed} - \text{Prevalence of disease in unexposed}$$

Population Attributable Risk (also known as etiologic fraction) is the measure of reduction in the incidence of the disease that can be expected if we eliminate the risk factor.

$$\mathrm{Population Attributable Risk} = \frac{\text{Incidence in total population} - \text{Incidence in unexposed population}}{\text{Incidence in total population}}$$

## Case-control Studies 

Begin with persons who have the disease of interest.

Match to cases without the disease.

Go back in time and assess risk factors and exposures.

Source population --> Cases with disease / Controls with no disease --> Four groups with 0,1 Disease and 0,1 Exposure --> Perform analysis

STEPS IN CONDUCTING THIS STUDY:

1.	Select source population.

2.	Identify and select cases.

3.	Identify and select controls.

4. Match cases to controls 

	- Only match on variables that are known risk factors for your disease of interest)

	- Do not match on variables whose relationship with the disease needs to be studied

	- Beware of unplanned matching and overmatching

	- Group matching or individual matching


5.	Measure exposure in cases and controls.

6.	Compare odds of exposure in diseased to odds of exposure in non-diseased persons.


### Use of Multiple Controls

•	Controls of the same type

•	Controls of different types

•	Multiple controls per case will increase the statistical power of your study

•	Up to case-control ratios of approximately 1:4

| Cross-sectional | Prospective         | Retrospective   |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Descriptive     | Risk factors        | Rare diseases   |

| Inexpensive     | Natural history 	| Uses records	  | 
| Large samples   | Attrition			| Small samples   |
| Exploratory     | Expensive    		| Matched controls|
|   			  | Calculate incidence | Quick / Bias	  |
